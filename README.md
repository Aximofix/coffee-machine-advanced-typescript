# Coffee Machine Advanced Kata

Advanced version of the Coffee Machine kata used for teaching **advanced unit testing techniques**.

## What you'll practice
- AAA pattern everywhere
- Testing errors with `toThrow`
- Mocking & verifying calls with `jest.fn`
- Resetting mocks with `beforeEach` / `jest.clearAllMocks`
- Acceptable duplication in tests vs helper functions
- Integration-like scenarios (combining rules)

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm test
```
